## Ayudame Restaurant Swiper App

This tinder-style web app is meant to help groups of people decide where they would like to eat. One person will create a session witha unique alphanumeric code which they can share with other users. Each user can swipe through restaurants, casting votes on where they would like to eat. Users can then view the results of the swiping to see the restaurants with the most votes.

### Tech Stack
This app was built using Ionic React on the front end with the intent to eventually convert to a native mobile app.
The backend was built with NodeJS and Express REST API and a MySQL database hosted on AWS.
